				Hello!<br/><br/>

				My name is Abhinav Garg, and I am presently working as a Senior Analytics Fellow with McKinsey  & Company, based out of the Gurgaon office. In this role, I have advised clients in more than 4 geographies on Risk Management and Analytics, with allied focus on Banking and Digital. <br/><br/>

				Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Bombay - where I was active academically and also led various student bodies. <br/><br/>

				In my time off, I like to read, learn new languages, run (endurance running - I've run up to 42.2 km), or play the guitar. I also travel actively, and have covered more than 10 countries so far.<br/><br/>

				If you'd like to reach out, please check the <em>Contact</em> menu, and introduce yourself. Cheers! <br/><br/>

				<li><b>General Electric</b> | GE Aviation - Thermal Systems Design Team</li>
				<span style = "margin-left:2em;">May-July 2015</span>
				<br/>
				I was an intern with General Electric at their research center in Bangalore (JFWTC). My work was on a project for understanding jet impingement heat transfer with the help of computational methods, and assess the applicability of various methods and turbulence models. It was a substantial experience - I really enjoyed the intellectual environment, and learnt a lot about heat transfer and flow dynamics.

				As a developer, I worked on creating a parser based on Natural Language Processing. It was a lot of fun to learn something completely new, and I was able to successfully complete the work assigned to me and was accredited their highest grade.
				<hr/>
				<li><b>Function Space</b></li>
				<span style = "margin-left:2em;">May-July 2014</span>
				<br/>
				As a developer, I worked on back-end by creating a computational toolkit for the platform, and on front-end by creating a website for a company campaign. My most important takeaways were improved skills in using Python (particularly how to deploy it in web applications), designing webpages (HTML, CSS, Javascript and its libraries), and sort of reconnecting with my Physics loving self - since Function Space was designed for discussions on Science.
				<hr/>
				<li><b>Shopsense</b></li>
				<span style = "margin-left:2em;">December 2013</span>
				<br/>
				As a developer, I worked on creating demo applications for the company. As this was my first intern, I took away a lot in terms of working in teams, and relished the culture at the startup. On the technical side of things, I picked skills in Photoshop, learnt a bit about design, substantially improved my coding skills in Python, and got used to regular working hours in companies - something which I later attempted to implement in my academic life too (which was pretty erratic earlier).

				22 February 2016<br/>
				New semester's going pretty great so far! Today, I pushed some content changes to the page, and am considering overhauling the design soon. The coursework is pretty hectic, no doubt, but all the courses that I've taken are of immense relevance to my interests. I've also been running, and can say that it is one of the most significant changes that the new year has brought. There's a new tab on the page now, <i>Running</i> - where you can check how I've been doing.
				<hr/> 
				30 November 2015<br/>
				I am starting with my winter work at the <a href="http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/~patankar/">Molecular Parisitology Lab</a> at IIT Bombay. It is a Science excursion that I am taking, putting to use whatever I learnt in the course BB 405 (Molecular Biology). It will also be my first significant exposure to wet biology. I'll be doing this along with continuing work on my BTP - entailing a busy, but fulfulling Winters.
				<hr/>
				26 November 2015<br/>
				A substantial semester has pulled to an end - more so because of how project centric it was as compared to course centric. The presentations for my B.Tech. Project and Supervised Learning Project went well, and I had interesting discussions with my guides and examiners. I hope to emulate and improve on this in the upcoming semesters, where work regarding my BTP intensifies. Lots to look forward to.
				<hr/>
				17 September 2015<br/>
				I have decided to convert to the Dual Degree Programme. This changes my graduation year from 2016 to 2017, when I will be graduating with both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree from IIT Bombay. The main objective behind this move was to undertake more research experience as I am really enjoying the projects that I've taken this semester. Hope it all turns out great.

				Starting January 2016, I took up a new year resolution that finally sustained! I've been running consistently (more or less) since then, and at present go for more than 6 km daily. It's challenging, empowering and exhilirating. On my blog in Wordpress, I've made a post regarding what finally worked. If you'd like, <a href="https://gargabhinav.wordpress.com/2016/02/12/running/">do give it a read</a>. <br/>
